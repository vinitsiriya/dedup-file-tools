Database helpers for dedup_file_tools_fs_copy.

Purpose:
    Provides initialization and schema management for the file copy job database. Ensures all required tables and indexes are present for tracking source files, destination files, and copy status.

Design Goals:
    - Robust, resumable, and auditable copy workflows
    - Safe concurrent access using RobustSqliteConn
    - Extensible schema for future features

    Initialize the job database for the file copy workflow.

    Args:
        db_path (str): Path to the SQLite database file.

    Implementation:
        - Creates tables for source_files, destination_files, and copy_status if they do not exist.
        - Sets up indexes for efficient lookup and status tracking.
        - Uses RobustSqliteConn for safe concurrent access.
        - Designed to be idempotent and safe to call multiple times.
