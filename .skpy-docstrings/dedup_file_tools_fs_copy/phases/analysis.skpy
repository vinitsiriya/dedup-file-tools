"""Analysis phase for dedup_file_tools_fs_copy.

Purpose:
    Scans source or destination directories, extracts file metadata, and persists it to the job database. Supports efficient, resumable, and auditable workflows for file copy operations.

Design Goals:
    - Accurate and efficient directory scanning
    - Robust metadata extraction and storage
    - Extensible for future metadata fields or analysis logic"""

    Yields:
