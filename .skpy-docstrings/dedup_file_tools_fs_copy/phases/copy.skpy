"""File: dedup_file_tools_fs_copy/phases/copy.py
Phase: Copy

Purpose:
    Orchestrates the copying of files from source to destination directories, ensuring deduplication, resumability, and robust error handling. Tracks copy status in the database, uses checksums to avoid redundant copies, and supports multi-threaded execution for performance.

Key Features:
    - Resets status for files missing from destination but marked as done
    - Identifies pending or failed copy tasks from the database
    - Performs deduplicated, resumable file copy operations with checksum verification
    - Updates copy status and destination file records in the database
    - Supports multi-threaded copying with progress reporting

Design Goals:
    - Deduplication, resumability, auditability, and robust error handling
    - Efficient, thread-safe database access and progress feedback"""

    Args:
        db_path (str): Path to the job database.
        dst_roots (list[str]): List of destination root directories.

    Implementation:
        - Scans the database for files marked as 'done'.
        - Checks if the file exists in any of the destination roots.
        - If missing, updates the status in the database to 'pending' for retry.
        - Uses ThreadPoolExecutor for parallel checks and tqdm for progress feedback.
        - Updates are performed sequentially to avoid DB locking."""

    Implementation:

    Implementation:

        threads (int): Number of worker threads to use.

    Implementation:
