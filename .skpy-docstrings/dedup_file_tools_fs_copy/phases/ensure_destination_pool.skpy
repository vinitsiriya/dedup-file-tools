"""Ensures that all files in the destination pool have up-to-date checksums in the shared checksum database.

Purpose:
    - Scans the destination pool for all files tracked in the job database.
    - Computes or loads checksums for each file and updates the checksum cache as needed.
    - Ensures deduplication and verification logic can rely on complete checksum data for all destination files.

Design Goals:
    - Robust, resumable, and auditable checksum management for destination pools
    - Efficient batch processing and progress feedback
    - Safe concurrent database access"""

    Args:
        job_dir (str): Path to the job directory.
        job_name (str): Name of the job.
        checksum_db (str): Path to the shared checksum database.

    Implementation:
        - Loads the list of destination files from the job database.
        - For each file, checks if a checksum exists in the cache; if not, computes and stores it.
        - Uses tqdm for progress reporting.
        - Handles errors and logs any issues encountered during processing.
        - Designed to be idempotent and safe to call multiple times."""
