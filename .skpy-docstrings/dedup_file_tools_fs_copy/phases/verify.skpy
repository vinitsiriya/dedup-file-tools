"""Verification phase for dedup_file_tools_fs_copy.

Purpose:
    Provides both shallow and deep verification of copied files. Shallow verification checks file existence, size, and timestamps; deep verification also compares checksums. Supports multithreaded execution and resumable verification.

Design Goals:
    - Reliable, auditable verification of copy results
    - Efficient, parallel verification for large datasets
    - Unified interface for both shallow and deep verification"""
