# Notes: Centralized Checksum Cache

- This is a breaking change and must be handled with care.
- All migration and upgrade steps must be clearly documented.
- Use the explicit validity marker in the cache for all logic.
- Test cache invalidation for all file identity changes.
- Use this as a template for future cache-centric features.
