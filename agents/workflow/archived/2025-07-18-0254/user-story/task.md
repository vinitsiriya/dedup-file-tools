# Implementation Tasks: Interactive Config Generator

## Tasks
- [ ] Design the interactive config generator flow and required questions.
- [ ] Add a new CLI command `generate-config` to `fs_copy_tool/main.py`.
- [ ] Implement interactive prompts for all required config fields (with validation, defaults, and help text).
- [ ] Implement logic to skip optional fields or accept defaults.
- [ ] Display a summary and ask for confirmation before writing the config file.
- [ ] Write the config as a valid YAML file, compatible with the `-c` option.
- [ ] Add tests for the interactive config generator (mocking input/output as needed).
- [ ] Update documentation (CLI, README, feature docs) to describe the new workflow.
- [ ] Verify the generated config works with the tool's `-c` option.
