# Implementation Note: Efficient File Move for dedup_file_tools_dupes_move

## Requirement
When moving duplicate files, always use the native `os.rename` (or `Path.rename`) function for moves within the same filesystem/drive. This ensures that moves are atomic and nearly instantaneous, as no data is copiedâ€”only directory entries are updated. This is critical for performance and correctness when moving large files on the same drive.

If the source and destination are on different filesystems/drives, fall back to a copy-and-delete approach, but always prefer the fast path when possible.

---

## Implementation Strategy
- Use `os.rename(src, dst)` or `Path(src).rename(dst)` for all moves.
- Before moving, check if `os.path.samefile(os.path.dirname(src), os.path.dirname(dst))` or use `os.stat(src).st_dev == os.stat(dst_dir).st_dev` to confirm both are on the same device.
- If on the same device, proceed with `rename`.
- If not, perform a copy (using `shutil.copy2` or similar), then delete the source file.
- Always handle exceptions and log the operation type (fast move vs. copy+delete).

## Example Code Snippet
```python
import os
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

def move_file(src, dst):
    src_path = Path(src)
    dst_path = Path(dst)
    dst_path.parent.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)
    try:
        # Fast path: same device
        if os.stat(src_path).st_dev == os.stat(dst_path.parent).st_dev:
            src_path.rename(dst_path)
            return 'fast-move'
        else:
            shutil.copy2(src_path, dst_path)
            src_path.unlink()
            return 'copy-delete'
    except Exception as e:
        # Log and handle error
        raise
```

---

## Auditability
- Log whether each move was a fast (rename) or slow (copy+delete) operation.
- Record errors and fallbacks for troubleshooting.
