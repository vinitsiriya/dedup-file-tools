# Agent Bootstrap: docs Directory Guide

This file provides strict instructions for agents on how and when to load documentation from the `docs` directory.

## Bootstrap Protocol for Documentation

- **Always consult `docs/index.md` first** to locate the correct documentation file for your task.
- **Before performing any task related to requirements, testing, CLI, or manual/integration/unit tests,** you MUST:
  1. Identify the relevant documentation file(s) in `docs/` using `index.md`.
  2. Load and review the full contents of those files.
  3. Ensure your working memory is up to date with the latest documentation before proceeding.
- **Never assume you remember the documentation.** Always check the relevant doc again before starting or continuing any related task.
- If you are unsure or have not checked the doc for your current task, STOP and review the appropriate file(s) in `docs/`.
- Failure to follow this protocol is a violation of project rules and may result in errors or omissions.
