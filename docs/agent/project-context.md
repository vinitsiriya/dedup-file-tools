# Project Context Documentation


This file serves as the central reference for project context awareness, requirements, and documentation protocols for agents and collaborators.

**Strict Protocol:**
You must strictly read all files listed in the Key Documentation References section below, as well as the `main.py` file in each main module directory, before performing any project action or making any changes. Skipping this step is a protocol violation.



## Key Documentation References (Must Read)
- `README.md` (project root): Main project overview and quick start.
- `main.py` (in each main module directory): **You must read this file for entry point logic and core workflow.**
- `docs/agent/project-context.md` (this file): Project context, documentation update protocol, and agent awareness.
- `docs/dedup_file_tools_dupes_move/user_prespective/README.md`: User perspective and CLI usage for dedup_file_tools_dupes_move.
- `docs/dedup_file_tools_fs_copy/user_prespective/README.md`: User perspective and CLI usage for dedup_file_tools_fs_copy.

## Documentation Update Protocol
- For step-by-step documentation update rules, see `docs/agent/documentation-agent-protocol.md`.
- Always follow the update order and cross-reference requirements as described in the documentation agent protocol.

## How to Use
- Agents and collaborators should always consult this file and the referenced documentation before making changes or performing project actions.
- Keep this file and all referenced documentation up to date as the project evolves.
